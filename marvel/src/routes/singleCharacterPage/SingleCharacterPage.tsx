  description:
    "The character was writer Roy Thomas homage to the Joe Simon and Jack Kirby character Captain 3-D, and was intended by Thomas as a commentary on contemporary societal themes using 1950s analogues. According to the characters artist co-creator Jim Craig, Thomas had initially told him 3-D Man was going to debut in his own magazine-format series in actual stereoscopic 3D, but after further researching the cost informed him that the budget would not cover it.[3] The character instead debuted in a three-issue run of the anthology series Marvel Premiere, issues #35â€“37 (1977). These comics, the first issue in particular, have a number of graphical elements clearly intended for their originally planned 3-D presentation.[3] Because 3-D Man's adventures take place in the 1950s, Craig had to spend extensive time at a library doing research for the story's setting.",
